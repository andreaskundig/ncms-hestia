community_description: "Dating Privacy is you and me: dating app users and
  people keen to understand privacy in relationships formed online. The
  collective is worried about the way our intimate life is being coded and
  exposed online. We aim to retake control of personal data on dating apps,
  understand the privacy problems they create, and work to improve data
  literacy."

  You have a meaningful project in mind that requires data? Happy to help! 

  HestiaLabs supports you in creating the [data collective](www.hestialabs.org/projects/) and the community of people willing to share their data for your project (the data sharers). **For free!**
mission_description: >-
  We want to understand many privacy risks that we, as dating app users, are
  confronted with when looking for a date online: unwanted ads, discrimination
  resulting from data, incorrect profiling and predictions, and the possibility
  of phishing and identity theft by rogue users.


  Our ultimate goal is to bring together users and privacy enthusiasts to push for a paradigm shift.
partners_description: >-
  We are looking to collaborate with journalists, researchers, activists and
  NGOs in data protection and other related themes.


  We push ideas for better user and company practices to control personal data and date safely online. We are particularly interested in raising awareness, as well as building methodological protocols and privacy tools for data protection and literacy.

  Artificial intelligence is changing the world. This revolution must benefit
  the many and not the few. For this to happen, individuals and organisations
  must be able to understand the algorithms behind the digital services they
  provide data to and what they get in return. 


  This paradigm shift will only be possible by building sustainable and trusted bridges between the people willing to share their data for a specific purpose and those with the know-how to achieve these goals. This led us to the creation of what we call .
