problem_title: The problem we solve
problem_description: >-
  Artificial intelligence is changing the world. This revolution must benefit
  the many and not the few. For this to happen, individuals and organisations
  must be able to understand the algorithms behind the digital services they
  provide data to and what they get in return. 


  This paradigm shift will only be possible by building sustainable and trusted bridges between the people willing to share their data for a specific purpose and those with the know-how to achieve these goals. This led us to the creation of what we call “[data collectives](www.hestialabs.org/projects/)”.

  You have a meaningful project in mind that requires data? Happy to help! 

  HestiaLabs supports you in creating the [data collective](www.hestialabs.org/projects/) and the community of people willing to share their data for your project (the data sharers). **For free!**
partners_description: We are very grateful to those who believe in us since the
  beginning, especially the [Migros Pioneer
  Fund](https://www.migros-pionierfonds.ch/en/kuhne-vorhaben). They allow us to

strategy_description: >-
  **Small shifts in personal habits lead to major societal changes**. People
  need concrete examples to understand the power of the data they generate. To
  prime the pump, HestiaLabs helps those who are already ready to reinvent our
  data future. 

  We support **community projects around personal data collectives**. We put our **skills** (technical, legal, advocacy) and **networks** at their disposal.
