      French-speaking Switzerland are based in
      [Geneva](https://mydatageneva.org/) and
      [Vaud](https://medium.com/mydatavaud). Thanks to its [extensive
      network](https://mydata.org/organisation-members/), MyData helps the

    description: >-
      Global nonprofit focused on data protection, PersonalData.IO encourages
      collaborative dynamics between the general public and civil society in all
      of its diversity (activists, researchers, educators, etc).


      Through its awareness-raising initiatives, it changes the perception of people outside our [data collectives](https://hestialabs.org/en/projects/) about the issues we address, and how they want to situate themselves as actors of change.
