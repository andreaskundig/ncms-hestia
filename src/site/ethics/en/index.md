  dating data is sensitive 


  **A collective of users**


  Dating Privacy is you and me: dating app users and people keen to understand privacy in relationships formed online. The collective is worried about the way our intimate life is being coded and exposed online. We aim to retake control of personal data on dating apps, understand the privacy problems they create, and work to improve data literacy.


  **A better understanding**


  We want to understand many privacy risks that we, as dating app users, are confronted with when looking for a date online: unwanted ads, discrimination resulting from data, incorrect profiling and predictions, and the possibility of phishing and identity theft by rogue users.


  **Connecting with partners**


  We are looking to collaborate with journalists, researchers, activists and NGOs in data protection and other related themes.


  We push ideas for better user and company practices to control personal data and date safely online. We are particularly interested in raising awareness, as well as building methodological protocols and privacy tools for data protection and literacy.
