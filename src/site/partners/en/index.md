    description: >-
      User data is the driving force behind many innovations. With the support
      of the Migros Pioneer Fund, HestiaLabs creates the processes and trusted
      software that bring users together to turn their forward-thinking ideas
      into social progress.


      **About Migros Pioneer Fund**

      The Migros Pioneer Fund looks for and supports ideas with social potential. It enables pioneering projects that break new ground and seek out forward-looking solutions. Its impact-oriented funding approach combines financial support with coaching services.

      Global nonprofit focused on data protection, PersonalData.IO encourages
      collaborative dynamics between the general public and civil society in all
      of its diversity (activists, researchers, educators, etc).


      Through its awareness-raising initiatives, it changes the perception of people outside our [data collectives](https://hestialabs.org/en/projects/) about the issues we address, and how they want to situate themselves as actors of change.

      The sum of data, problems and situations tackled by the data collectives
      we support is an inexhaustible source of knowledge about data science,
      individual rights and privacy.


      HestiaLabs would be delighted to team up with an academic partner or partners. Their expertise and legitimacy on these topics would enhance the value of this knowledge and give it the scientific resonance it deserves.


      HestiaLabs is currently working with multiple labs and units at the [University of Genève](https://www.unige.ch/) and the [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch).

      Privacy is everyone's concern in our digital world. Would you like to be
      the first to know about major new developments in this area?\

      \

      Like David against Goliath, HestiaLabs is taking on the data monopoly economy for the benefit of all. [With success](https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1381776266630664198?s=20).\

      \

      Unlike (many) others, we do not produce opinions but facts: data analysis, tangible innovations, scientific knowledge…\

      \

      Another distinctive feature: We do it with and for the users of digital services, not without their knowledge.\

      \

      Help your audience connect the dots and play your role as the fourth estate by covering our efforts.
