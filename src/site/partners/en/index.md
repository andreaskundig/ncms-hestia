    description: "[MyData is a global movement](http://mydata.org) encouraging
      individual empowerment around personal data. Its local chapters in
      French-speaking Switzerland are based in
      [Geneva](https://mydatageneva.org/) and
      [Vaud](https://medium.com/mydatavaud). Thanks to its [extensive
      network](https://mydata.org/organisation-members/), MyData helps the
      projects supported by HestiaLabs to find other relevant partners."
  - title: PersonalData.IO
    description: >-
      Global nonprofit focused on data protection, PersonalData.IO encourages
      collaborative dynamics between the general public and civil society in all
      of its diversity (activists, researchers, educators, etc).


      Through its awareness-raising initiatives, it changes the perception of people outside our [data collectives](https://hestialabs.org/en/projects/) about the issues we address, and how they want to situate themselves as actors of change.

      The sum of data, problems and situations tackled by the data collectives
      we support is an inexhaustible source of knowledge about data science,
      individual rights and privacy.


      HestiaLabs would be delighted to team up with an academic partner or partners. Their expertise and legitimacy on these topics would enhance the value of this knowledge and give it the scientific resonance it deserves.


      HestiaLabs is currently working with multiple labs and units at the [University of Genève](https://www.unige.ch/) and the [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch).

      Is your editorial staff aware of the personal data issue? Would you like
      to be the first to know about major developments in this area?


      Unlike (many) others, HestiaLabs does not produce opinions but facts: data analysis, tangible innovations, scientific knowledge...


      Play your role as the fourth estate by covering our efforts.
