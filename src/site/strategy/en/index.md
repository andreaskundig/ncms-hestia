  "The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click
  ads. That sucks", said [the creator of Facebook's data team as he
  resigned](https://web.archive.org/web/20160307232436/http://www.bloomberg.com:80/bw/magazine/content/11_17/b4225060960537.htm).
  He was right. That sucks. But he was wrong too:  some of the "best minds of
  his generation" refuse to let a few multinationals control the huge profits
  from our shared data. And you know what? [They work for
  HestiaLabs](https://hestialabs.org/en/about/).


  At HestiaLabs, we dream of a digital world where **users take back control over their data**. A digital world where **the benefits generated by data processing are shared with those who produce them**. A digital world where **service providers and users decide together** which data will be used and for what purpose. A digital world where **transparency is the norm**.


  **A truly user-centric digital world.**


  To make this dream come true, we must deconstruct the idea that the current data valuation model is the norm to build a more ethical one.


  Habits are hard to change. We are not afraid of the difficulties. We rely on the [Four Dimensions of Change framework](https://www.openupcontracting.org/assets/2017/09/Hivos-ToC-guidelines-2015.pdf) to shift mindsets. At the individual collective and societal levels (see below).


  We do this not by shouting one opinion among many, but by taking concrete actions. How? We do the - hard - job no one else does: processing data.


  You have a meaningful project in mind that requires data?

    description: >-
      Each individual should realise, within himself, those three things:


      1. His or her data is valuable

      2. He or she is currently dispossessed of it

      3. He or she has rights in this regard, which he or she must actively use


      HestiaLabs takes care to select projects and partners mature in this raising-awareness aspect, and focuses on its key asset: collective action.

  - title: A conversation strikes up
    description: >-
      Now aware of a problem that he/she understands well, the individual
      wonders how to deal with it. He or she discusses it around him or her and
      seeks out peers who are concerned about the same issues.


      This "individual external" dimension of the theory of change is the playground of our partner [PersonalData.io](https://wiki.personaldata.io/wiki/Main_Page): it invites anyone who feels lost as to their individual data rights to talk to each other and pool a set of resources.
