  HestiaLabs supports meaningful projects based on personal data in creating
  the [data
  collectives](https://hestialabs.org/www.hestialabs.org/projects/) and the
  community of people willing to share their data to help them achieve their
  goals (the data sharers).


  Data sharers are obviously at the heart of these ecosystems, without them there would be no project. In orbit around them, five key players must work together to give these projects the desired individual, collective and social impact.
