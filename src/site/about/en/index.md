  Dreaming of a data-driven breakthrough?

  Let’s talk
story_title: A short story about us
story: >-
  The work of HestiaLabs' founder (the mathematician Paul-Olivier Dehaye) led to
  the revelation of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal (2018) and the
  writing of "Love under Algorithm", a book deconstructing Tinder's algorithm
  (2019).


  “Paul-Olivier Dehaye is today one of the best experts on this issue in the world. His aim is not to climb this kind of summit any further. Rather to contribute to the emergence of solutions and instruments likely to bring about change”, wrote Paris-Match. HestiaLabs is one of them.
