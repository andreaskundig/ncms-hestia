      Global nonprofit focused on data protection, PersonalData.IO encourages
      collaborative dynamics between the general public and civil society in all
      of its diversity (activists, researchers, educators, etc).


      It helped our collective to emerge by gathering us and helped us to think together. Its wiki platform provided us with the structure we needed to start working on dating app data (giving us access to store, manage and access structured data).
